President Hoover addresses Britainâ€™s departure from the gold standard in a press conference. Britain goes off the gold standard on September 21, 1931 in an effort to solve the continuing economic crisis. Americans, fearing that the United States will soon do the same, begin to withdraw their money from banks and hoard gold. Over the next month, 827 more banks will close.
