Donald Trump
January 06, 2021
On January 6, 2021, Trump supporters and white supremacists gathered to protest the results of the 2020 presidential election. A mob overwhelmed Capitol police and pushed their way into the US Capitol, where Congress was meeting to certify the election results. As members of Congress were rushed out of harm's way, police were unable to contain the intruders who broke windows, destroyed property, and trespassed through the building. The police shot and killed one pro-Trump demonstrator as she tried to break through a door, and one Capitol police officer died of injuries sustained during the riot. 
During the chaos, President Trump released this one-minute video via Twitter. He makes several false claims, including that the presidential election was fraudulent despite the Department of Justice reporting that they found no evidence of widespread fraud. Shortly after this video was posted, Twitter removed it for violating its rules and blocked President Trump's Twitter account for 12 hours, but restored it after that time.

We don't want anybody hurt. It is a very tough period of time.
There has never been a time like this where such a thing happened, where they could take it away from all of us, from me, from you, from our country.
This was a fraudulent election, but we can't play into the hands of these people.
We have to have peace. So go home. We love you. You are very special. You've see what happens. You see the way others are treated that are so bad and so evil. I know how you feel. But go home and go home.... (video cuts off early)
