This State of the Union by President Dwight Eisenhower was read before a joint session of Congress rather than given by the president himself. In September 1955, President Eisenhower had a heart attack, and in early January 1956, he was recuperating down in Key West, Florida. In the speech, Eisenhower warns about the threat of Soviet and Chinese communism and stresses the need to improve US national security. He points toward efforts to bring federal finances under control and the success of a tax cut to build up the economy. He also urges Congress to grant statehood for Hawaii.
