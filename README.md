READ BEFORE RUNNING THE FILE

The program should be run with a directory file linking to a directory comprised of different speeches in it's RUN CONFIGURATION.
This is crucial as the program will not work without it. Additionally, please go into the code and specify on LINE 98 in Main.java
where you would like the exported .csv files to go, otherwise the program will store them directly into the Project directory
