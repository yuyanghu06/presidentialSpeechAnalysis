Address Delivered before the Ohio Society of New York, Waldorf Hotel, New York City
The debate over whether the Senate should agree to the Treaty of Versailles with its provision for entry into the League of Nations continued through the fall of 1919 and early months of 1920. On January 10, 2910, Senator Harding spoke to the meeting of the Ohio Society of New York at the Waldorf Hotel in New York City. He cautioned that America should hesitate before surrendering its hard won nationality to the dream of the internationalists--the League of Nations--and to "think of America first." The Senate rejected the treaty by seven votes in March 1920.
