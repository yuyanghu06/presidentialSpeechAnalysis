On November 12,1921, President Harding convened in Washington the most significant arms limitation conference of the inter-war era. Represented were the major political and military powers including Belgium, China, Great Britain, Italy, France, the Netherlands, Portugal, and Japan.
Mindful of Wilson’s ill-fated experience and inability to gain consent for the Treaty of Versailles and the League of Nations by the Senate, President Harding elected to welcome and challenge the invited diplomats, and then delegate the negotiations to Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes. He also ensured that the U.S. delegation contained important Congressional Republicans including Senator Henry Cabot Lodge. After the formalities of the negotiations were completed, leaving nothing to chance, Harding spoke in person to the Senate on February 10, 1922 and submitted the treaties for consent. He noted that he was respectful of the Senate’s part in contracting foreign relations, then added “I have come to know the viewpoint and inescapable responsibility of the executive” and then asked for expeditious agreement.
The treaties resulted in the only successful limitation and reduction of armament the world had known to that time.
